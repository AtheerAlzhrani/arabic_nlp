# Project2: Linguistic Analysis of Arabic Text Using Stanza


*Objective:* This project aims to provide comprehensive linguistic analysis of the Arabic text utilizing the Stanza library.


**Steps Involved:**

* Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging: Identify the grammatical categories of words (e.g., nouns, verbs, adjectives) to understand their syntactic roles.
* Dependency Parsing: Analyze the grammatical structure of sentences to determine how words are related to each other.
* Named Entity Recognition (NER): Detect and classify entities such as names, locations, and organizations within the text.
* Lemmatization: Normalize words to their base or dictionary forms to standardize variations.
* Morphological Analysis: Study the structure of words to understand their form and formation rules.
